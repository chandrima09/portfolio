With over 8 years of hands-on experience in Networking, Security, Cloud, and Operations, I have led and executed the design and implementation of comprehensive configuration and compliance policies across various platforms. This includes developing and managing security policies for Microsoft Defender and Intune, such as EDR, antivirus, and firewall configurations, to ensure robust protection and compliance within organizational systems.

I have extensive experience in configuring and maintaining a range of security policies, including compliance, conditional access, antivirus, and firewall settings. I have worked with Cisco firewalls and routers, gaining practical knowledge in securing network infrastructure. In addition, I have supported internal teams by automating business processes and workflows through tools like Power Automate and Microsoft Visio.

My experience spans multiple domains, including risk management, access management, vulnerability management, and cloud security, providing me with a holistic understanding of information security practices and solutions tailored to diverse business environments.

## Objective

My journey in Networking, Cloud and systems has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC).
